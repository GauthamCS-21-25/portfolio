          <div class="slogan">"Crafting elegant solutions, one line of code at a time"</div>

          <p>I have been born and brought up in Thrissur. I have done my schooling at Mary Matha ICSE School, Pudukkad. I came to Kochi in 2021 to pursue my degree course. For my graduation, I chose B. Tech Computer Science and Engineering at Rajagiri School of Engineering & Technology. My passion for helping others publish their skills and talents using the digital platform has been evident in my involvement in building a few websites and applications.</p><br>
          <p>Website and App development were my gateway to the creative industry which inspired me to start my own projects and to first steps in the digital world. I have been coding for 3 years now. I started as a website UI/UX developer and worked my way up to become a front-end developer.</p><br>
          <p>I have been mostly involved in establishing effective client relationships. I have also developed a superior understanding of client service and client relationship with this span of time. Through these experiences I have learned to interact with a diverse group of people, which has increased my ability to relate to others. </p>
